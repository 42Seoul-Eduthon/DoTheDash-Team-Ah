# Evaluation

## Excersize 00

- [ ] Check there is only single function which uses \_\_FUNCTION__ MARCRO.
- [ ] Ask about predefined MACROS such as \_\_FUNCTION__, \_\_LINE__, \_\_FILE__

## Excersize 01

- [ ] Is Conditional compilation implemented by Preprocessor? If No, the evaluation stops here.
- [ ] Ask abonut predefined MACROS, and the meaning of the MACRO used by student being evaluated.
- [ ] The student must explain about headers and functions what they used, and difference between Operating Systems. During evaluation, check every function is availabe in both of Windows and macOS. If any of incompatible function presents, evaluation stops here with 0 grade.

## Excersize 02

- [ ] Explain about MACRO function, what is it, why we use it, and difference between normal functions.
- [ ] Explain about endian, difference of 32 bits processor and 64 bit processor.

By using -D optioin of cc, check all values below:

FT_USE_32_BIT<br/>
FT_USE_64_BIT<br/>
FT_USE_LITTLE_ENDIAN<br/>
FT_USE_BIG_ENDIAN<br/>

- [ ] Does it works as expected?
