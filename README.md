# Preprocessor Deep Dive

## How to participate in this process

1. Read The [Subject](./subject.pdf)

2. Make your own _repository_ for submit

3. Read each assignment and create a file in the _repository_ where you need to submit. (like ex00/ft_get_filename.c)

4. Download [workflow file](workflow.yml) for Multi-Architecture Test with **Github Action**!

## What can we learn from this course?

- Multi architecture support programming

- Write the Code with low function call overhead

- Operations that do not care about parameters

## How to use Github Action

1. Place the [workflow file](workflow.yml) in your _repository_, `.github/workflows`

2. And just Run `git push`

3. The submission repository structure is as follows:

```text
.github
ㄴ workflows
  ㄴ workflow.yml
ex00
ㄴ somefile
ex01
ㄴ somefile
```
